<b>This app only stores the data of the plants and their tasks in a SQLite storage right on your device.</b>

It works without ever connecting to the internet - except for when you manually press the "Leave a Review" button on the Settings page. And even there, it only leads you to the App Store.

If you don't trust the above, the entire source code is available in this very repository.
